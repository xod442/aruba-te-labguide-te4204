```{note}
VSX Configuration is being skipped in this workshop due to limited hardware availability, but it is always recommended to configure a high-availability setup for critical server workloads. Refer to our Validated Solutions Guide (VSG) to learn more:  

https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/VSG/docs/050-dc-deploy/esp-dc-deploy-120-fabric-deploy/#configure-vsx-on-leaf-switches
```  

You were _assigned a pod number_ at the start of the workshop. Add a zero in front of it and it becomes the _lab group number_. In the third octet of the IP address, start with the number 2 and add your lab group number to it. As an example, user1 = lab group 01 â€“ 3rd octet, 201. The AFC IP for lab group 01 would be 10.250.201.30

## Lab 2.1 - Logging into the AFC 

### Description  
In this workflow the Aruba Fabric Composer (AFC) will automate configuring the routed interfaces and assigning IP addresses.  Once complete, the network will be ready to deploy the Underlay network.  

### Validate  
1. Open a new browser tab/window and log into the HPE Aruba Networking Fabric Composer (AFC).  Use the following URL and credentials to access the AFC.

|||
|---|---|
|URL|``https://10.250.2LG.30`` where **LG = your Lab Group Number**|
|Username|``admin``|
|Password|``admin``|

## Lab 2.3 - AFC Host Visualization

### Description  
Once vSphere is integrated with AFC, AFC will use RESTful APIs to poll vSphere to gather an inventory of hosts, VMs, Networks, etc.  We will explore the AFC Host Visualization in this lab.

### Validate  
1. Open the AFC, click the **Visualization** menu, and select **Hosts**

![Visualizations Menu](images/lab3-visualizations-menu.png)  
_Fig. Lab 2 Visualizations Menu_  

2. At the bottom of the page go to the **VM** list (Click VMS) find and select your lab-groups workload servers. **LG[LG]WL01-v10-101** and **LG[LG]-WL02-v10-102**.  

```{note}
You may have to expand the lower part of the screen to access this list.  In this example, LG01 VM's are selected.
```

![VM Workload List](images/lab3-vm-workload-list.png)  
_Fig. Lab 2 VM Workload List_  

```{note}
AFC Host Visualization defaults to Lab Group 01. Be sure to select your lab to see your diagram. Your lab will be 10.250.0.1**LG**, where **LG** is your Lab Group Number.  You may have to expand the lower part of the screen to access the list.  *LG01 VM's are selected in this example*  
```

### Expected Results  

Verify that the host address matches the one connected to your switches. Use the following table as reference.


| Lab Group | vSphere Host | Lab Group | vSphere Host | 
|---|---| ---|---|
| 01 | 10.250.0.101 | 06 | 10.250.0.106 |
| 02 | 10.250.0.102 | 07 | 10.250.0.107 |

| 05 | 10.250.0.105 | 10 | 10.250.0.110 |

```{note} 
Verify you see the physical connections to your leaf group. If you do not see the connections, the ports may be down on the switches. You can use show interface brief on the command line of the switch and look for port 1/1/1 on each switch.  
```

## Lab 4.3 - Integrate PSM 

### Description
Using the AFC we will now add an integration with the AMD Pensando Policy and Services Manager (PSM).  PSM provides centralized management and visibility of all stateful services running in the infrastructure.  AFC acts as an abstraction layer for some of the PSM stateful functions.
